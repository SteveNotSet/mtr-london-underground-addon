The *MTR London Underground* Mod is originally developed by the most stupid MTRMOD developer - cherbert.

## What did I modify?

- Removed Pride.
- Removed most of those foolish deprecated blocks.
- Shrinked the stupid textures of the staircase blocks.
- Shared same texture files between the integrated trains and rail models.
- Changed all the idiot 129×128 textures into 128×128, 258×256 into 256×256.
- Changed the daft models which are pretending to be blocks into real blocks.
